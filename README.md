** Here I have built a demo login page to implement jason Power database (JsonPowerDB) developed by Login2Explore**

The following are the benfits of using jsonPowerDB:

1) Minimum development cost
2) Minimum time to market
3) Minimize the complexity of interoperability of differnt applications
4) Maximum data processing performance
5) Technology Futuristic

-> Fills gap from database to big data
-> Pluggable with new algorithms
-> Pluggable and user defined API

6) Minimize total cost of ownership
